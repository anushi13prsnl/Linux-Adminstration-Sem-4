# Lab 13 & 14: File Ownership and Permissions in Linux

## Objective
The goal of this lab is to understand and implement file ownership and permission management in Linux using the `chown` and `chmod` commands along with their various options.

---

## Commands and Concepts Used

### 1. Managing File Ownership with `chown`

The `chown` command allows you to change the owner and/or group of files and directories.

#### a. **Basic Usage of `chown`**

##### Example 1: Change the Owner of a File
```bash
sudo chown operator1 testfile.txt
```

##### Example 2: Verify the Ownership Change
```bash
ls -l testfile.txt
```

---

#### b. **Changing Both Owner and Group**

##### Example: Modify Both Owner and Group Simultaneously
```bash
sudo chown operator1:operator2 testfile.txt
```

#### Screenshot:

---

#### c. **Recursive Ownership Changes**

##### Example: Apply Ownership Changes Recursively to a Directory
```bash
sudo chown -R operator1:operator1 testdirectory/
```

#### Screenshot:

---

#### d. **Using a Reference File for Ownership**

##### Example: Copy Ownership from Another File
```bash
sudo chown --reference=referencefile.txt targetfile.txt
```

### 2. Managing File Permissions with `chmod`

The `chmod` command is used to modify file access permissions for the owner, group, and others.

#### a. **Setting Permissions Using Numeric Mode (Octal)**

##### Example 1: Assign Read, Write, and Execute Permissions to the Owner Only
```bash
chmod 700 testfile.txt
```
This sets read (4), write (2), and execute (1) permissions for the owner (7), and no permissions for group or others (0).

#### Screenshot:

##### Example 2: Assign Read and Write for Owner, Read for Group and Others
```bash
chmod 644 testfile.txt
```
This sets read and write permissions (6) for the owner, and read-only permissions (4) for both group and others.

---

#### b. **Setting Permissions Using Symbolic Mode**

##### Example 1: Add Execute Permission for the Owner
```bash
chmod u+x testfile.txt
```

#### Screenshot:

##### Example 2: Remove Write Permission for the Group
```bash
chmod g-w testfile.txt
```

#### Screenshot:

##### Example 3: Add Read Permission for Others
```bash
chmod o+r testfile.txt
```

#### Screenshot:

##### Example 4: Set Multiple Permissions at Once
```bash
chmod u+rwx,g+rx,o+r testfile.txt
```

#### Screenshot:
![Setting multiple permissions](screenshots/chmod_multiple.png)

---

#### c. **Recursive Permission Changes**

##### Example: Apply Permissions Recursively to a Directory
```bash
chmod -R 755 testdirectory/
```

#### Screenshot:

---

#### d. **Special Permissions**

##### Example 1: Set SUID Permission
```bash
chmod u+s testfile.txt
```
SUID (Set User ID) allows a user to execute a file with the permissions of the file owner.

#### Screenshot:
![Setting SUID permission](screenshots/chmod_suid.png)

##### Example 2: Set SGID Permission
```bash
chmod g+s testdirectory/
```
SGID (Set Group ID) ensures that new files created in the directory inherit the group of the directory.

#### Screenshot:
![Setting SGID permission](screenshots/chmod_sgid.png)

##### Example 3: Set Sticky Bit
```bash
chmod +t testdirectory/
```
The sticky bit prevents users from deleting files owned by others in the directory.

---

### 3. Combining `chown` and `chmod`

##### Example: Change Ownership and Permissions Together
```bash
sudo chown operator1:operator2 testfile.txt
chmod 750 testfile.txt
```

#### Screenshot:
![Combined ownership and permission change](screenshots/chown_chmod_combined.png)

---

### 4. Advanced Options

#### a. **Using the `--preserve-root` Option**

The `--preserve-root` option prevents recursive operations on the root directory (`/`).

```bash
sudo chmod --preserve-root -R 777 /directory
```

#### Screenshot:
![Using preserve-root option](screenshots/chmod_preserve_root.png)

---

#### b. **Using the `-v` (Verbose) Option**

The `-v` option outputs a message for every file processed.

```bash
chmod -v 644 testfile.txt
```

#### Screenshot:
![Using verbose option](screenshots/chmod_verbose.png)

---

#### c. **Using the `-c` (Changes) Option**

The `-c` option reports only when a change is made.

```bash
chmod -c 644 testfile.txt
```

#### Screenshot:
![Using changes option](screenshots/chmod_changes.png)

---

## Permission and Ownership Verification

### 1. **Verifying Permissions and Ownership**

#### Example: Use `ls -l` to Check Permissions and Ownership
```bash
ls -l testfile.txt
```

#### Screenshot:
![Verifying permissions and ownership](screenshots/verify_permissions.png)

#### Understanding the Output:
- First character: File type (`-` for regular file, `d` for directory)
- Next three characters: Owner permissions (`r`=read, `w`=write, `x`=execute)
- Next three characters: Group permissions
- Last three characters: Others permissions
- Username and group name indicate ownership

## Permission Calculator Reference

### Numeric Permissions

| Number | Permission Type         | Symbol  |
|--------|-------------------------|---------|
| 0      | No Permission           | ---     |
| 1      | Execute                 | --x     |
| 2      | Write                   | -w-     |
| 3      | Write + Execute         | -wx     |
| 4      | Read                    | r--     |
| 5      | Read + Execute          | r-x     |
| 6      | Read + Write            | rw-     |
| 7      | Read + Write + Execute  | rwx     |

## Conclusion

In this lab, you practiced:
1. Changing file and directory ownership using the `chown` command
2. Modifying file and directory permissions using the `chmod` command
3. Applying recursive changes to directories and their contents
4. Setting special permissions (SUID, SGID, and Sticky Bit)
5. Verifying permission and ownership changes

These skills are essential for managing file security, controlling access to resources, and maintaining a secure Linux environment.
